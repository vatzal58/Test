**Solution:** Develop a React frontend for role-based dashboards (tasks, goals, comments) and dynamic graphs (Chart.js). Build .NET Core APIs for CRUD operations, JWT authentication, and integration with a Python SpaCy NLP microservice (parsing deadlines/task types). Store data in MS SQL Server (Users, Tasks, Goals, Transactions). Use SpaCy to auto-schedule tasks (e.g., “weekly chores”) and .NET to calculate metrics (completion rates, goal progress). Enable parents to link tasks to financial goals (auto-deposit on approval) and deploy via Docker/AWS with encrypted data.
