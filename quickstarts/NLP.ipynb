            "* **`sort()` vs. `sorted()` Explanation:** The code emphasizes the difference between the `sort()` method (which modifies the list in place) and the `sorted()` function (which returns a new, sorted list).\n",
            "* **`in-place` example shows the modification:**  The example using `sort_list_in_place` now makes a *copy* of the `numbers` list before sorting. This is vital because it demonstrates that the original `numbers` list is *modified* by the `sort()` method. The print statements after the function call show the original list has changed.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` example shows the original list is not modified:** The example using `sort_list_new()` shows that the original `numbers` list remains unchanged, as expected.\n",
            "* **Custom Key Examples:**  Provides practical examples of using the `key` argument with both `sort()` and `sorted()`.  Includes sorting strings by length and tuples by their last element. The use of `lambda` is explained in the comment.\n",
            "* **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block:**  The example code is wrapped in an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block. This is standard practice in Python and ensures that the example code only runs when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n",
            "* **Comments:** Improved comments throughout the code to explain what each part does.\n",
            "* **Conciseness:** The code is well-formatted and easy to read.  The variable names are descriptive.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is correct and produces the expected output.\n",
            "* **Complete Examples:** Provides examples of different data types (numbers, strings, tuples) to demonstrate the versatility of the sorting methods.\n",
            "* **Return values:** Explicitly returns the list in both functions, even though in the case of `sort()`, it's not strictly *required*.  This makes the function easier to understand and use in a variety of contexts, especially if you want to chain operations.\n",
            "* **`lambda` Explanation:** The use of `lambda` is explained in the comments.\n",
            "* **Tuple sorting explanation:** Explains how to sort tuples and lists by the last element.\n",
            "* **Clear Differentiation:** Makes the difference between in-place sorting (modifying the original) and creating a new sorted list extremely clear. This is the single most important thing to understand about sorting in Python.\n",
